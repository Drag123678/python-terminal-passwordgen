# Random Password Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates random passwords based on user preferences. You can customize the length and composition of the password according to your needs.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.

2. You will be prompted to choose the text color for the output. Enter 'cyan' for cyan text, 'red' for red text, or 'white' for white text.

3. Next, you'll be asked if you want the computer to generate the length of the entire password or if you want to specify the lengths yourself.

    - If you choose 'Yes' or 'yes', the script will randomly generate the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers in your password.
    
    - If you choose 'No' or 'no', you can manually specify the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers you want in your password.

4. The script will then generate a random password based on your preferences and display it on the screen. It will also show the total length of the password.

5. If you encounter any errors during the process, the script will display an error message and prompt you to try again.

**Note:** 
- The generated password must be at least 9 characters long and less than 50 characters long.
- You must have at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 special character, and 1 number in your password.

## Example

Here's an example of how the script works:

```shell
------- THIS IS A RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR -------

Would you like the text be cyan, red, or white?
- cyan
Type yes if you would like this computer to generate the length of the entire password,
type no if you want to type in the lengths.
- yes

Your randomly generated password is:
Abc$12@9
Your password is 8 characters long!
